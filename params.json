Have you falling into the snack wagon?  Along with last month’s fitness New Year’s resolutions revisited, eating healthy is always high up on the list of the most popular resolutions every year.  Goals need details to stick, and OpenStreetMap needs details to grow.  Let’s combine the two by adding and enhancing grocery stores in OpenStreetMap.  Eating healthy often involves eating more fruit and vegetables.  Where do you find those?  In the grocery store.  \r\n\r\nBusiness listings and other points of interest are slowly gaining momentum in OpenStreetMap.  Curious to know how prevalent grocery stores and similar businesses are in OpenStreetmap?  Check out this chart which includes the same cities featured in our previous post:\r\n\r\n| | Grocery Points of Interest | with Addresses | with Website | with Hours |\r\n| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |\r\n| **Auckland** | 334 | 6% | 1% | 1% |\r\n| **Dublin** | 690 | 14% | 4% | 5% |\r\n| **Hong Kong** | 494 | 6% | 1% | 3% |\r\n| **Melbourne** | 218 | 35% | 31% | 17% |\r\n| **Mexico City** | 701 | 8% | 1% | 6% |\r\n| **Mumbai** | 120 | 7% | 2% | 2% |\r\n| **San Francisco** | 706 | 48% | 19% | 16% |\r\n| **São Paulo** | 799 | 22% | 6% | 3% |\r\n| **Seoul** | 1068 | 2% | 0.28% | 1% |\r\n| **Singapore** | 334 | 12% | 6% | 5% |\r\n| **Stockholm** | 43 | 14% | 19% | 7% |\r\n| **Vancouver** | 187 | 35% | 11% | 12% |\r\n\r\nLots of opportunities to enhance existing features and add missing ones!\r\n\r\n####Helpful Tags\r\n\r\nIf your personal food pyramid is not what you'd like it to be, get inspired by adding or enhancing grocery related businesses in OpenStreetMap!

Enhance those first.  Do you pass by a particularly fancy market that you'd like to shop at regular?  Save those details in OpenStreetMap for future retrieval.  Maybe you just need a kitchen gadget to get you excited to cook again!  What is your go-to store for cooking supplies?  Explore the [OpenStreetMap wiki](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Map_Features) for the appropriate tags to accompany the new features you would like to add to the map!  \r\n\r\n####Interactive Map\r\nWould it be helpful to see where the current grocery related POIs are in OpenStreetMap?
